Module: A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py
Now we can use the module we just created, by using the import statement.
Python has a lot of modules we can import and use. They are stored in the Lib folder.
Python default modules documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html

We can also use third file modules which can be installed on our system with pip.
Pip is a package manager.
